## Development Guide

### Usage

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch for changes:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Additionally, if you wish to run the plugin every time it is built:

```bash
npm run start
```

### Debugging

To view the output of your `console.log`, you have a few different options:

- Use the [`sketch-dev-tools`](https://github.com/skpm/sketch-dev-tools)
- Run `skpm log` in your Terminal, with the optional `-f` argument (`skpm log -f`) which causes `skpm log` to not stop when the end of logs is reached, but rather to wait for additional data to be appended to the input
